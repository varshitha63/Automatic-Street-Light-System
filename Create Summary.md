The Automatic Street Light System uses IoT tools like Arduino and sensors to save electricity and enhance safety. The system automatically turns street lights on or off based on surrounding light levels or motion detection, eliminating the need for manual control. During daylight, the lights remain off, while they activate during low light or when vehicles or pedestrians are detected at night. This automation reduces energy wastage and ensures better visibility on roads, helping prevent accidents. The system is cost-effective, efficient, and eco-friendly, making it a practical solution for modernizing street lighting in smart cities.
